				<h1>GAME</h1>
				The purpose of this game is to guess the code (5 different colour pegs) in less than 12 trials (the lesser, the better).<br>
				Player must click one of the 8 colours provided on the right. <br>
				The game start on top of the board.<br>
				Once player click the button, it will move the colour into the big circle.<br>
				Player can delete the previous answer in each trial. But, once the player has chosen 5 colours<br>
				the answer will be marked (cannot be removed anymore).<br>
				The mark will be shown like following : <br>
				-	Black = correct answer and correct position <br>
				-	White = correct answer and wrong position <br>
				-	Blank = wrong answer <br>
				Once the player achieves 5 black marks, the player win the round. <br>
				Points will be received depends on how many trials needed. <br>
				-	1 trial = 7 points <br>
				-	2 – 4 trials = 5 points<br>
				-	5 – 8 trials = 4 points <br>
				-	9 – 12 trials = 3 points <br>
				-	Cannot solve = 0 point.<br>
				If the game is 2 players, after each round, it will be another player’s turn.<br>
				If any player can achieve at least as written in Target Score, he/she win.<br>
				In the end of the game, player will be asked to restart the game (type “Y” or “y”), or not (Type “N” or “n”)<br>
